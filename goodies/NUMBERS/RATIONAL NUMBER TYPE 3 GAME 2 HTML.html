  <span class="label">Step 1: Understanding the method</span><br>
  We will use the <b>method of contradiction</b>.<br>
  In this method, we first assume the opposite of what we want to prove.<br>
  If this assumption leads to a contradiction, then the assumption must be false.
  `);

  add(`
  <span class="label">Step 2: Making the opposite assumption</span><br>
  We assume that √${n} is a rational number.<br>
  If √${n} is rational, it can be written as a fraction of two integers.
  `);

  add(`
  <span class="label">Step 3: Writing √${n} as a fraction</span><br>
  So we write √${n} = p / q.<br>
  Here, p and q are integers.<br>
  Also, q is not equal to zero, because division by zero is not allowed.
  `);

  add(`
  <span class="label">Step 4: Writing the fraction in lowest form</span><br>
  Any fraction can be simplified to its lowest form.<br>
  After simplification, we write √${n} = a / b.<br>
  Here, a and b are co-prime numbers.<br>
  This means that a and b have no common factor except 1.
  `);

  add(`
  <span class="label">Important background theorem</span><br>
  The following result is based on a corollary of the <b>Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</b>.<br><br>
  The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 is either
  a prime number itself or can be written as a unique product of prime numbers,
  regardless of the order of the factors.<br>
  This is also known as the <b>unique factorization theorem</b>.<br><br>
  From this theorem, we get the following result (Theorem 1.2):<br>
  <b>Let p be a prime number. If p divides a², then p divides a,
  where a is a positive integer.</b>
  `);

  add(`
  <span class="label">Step 5: Removing the square root</span><br>
  From √${n} = a / b, we multiply both sides by b.<br>
  This gives √${n} · b = a.<br>
  Now we square both sides to remove the square root.<br>
  After squaring, we get ${n}b² = a². <b>(Equation I)</b>
  `);

  add(`
  <span class="label">Step 6: Using divisibility</span><br>
  From equation (I), we see that ${n} multiplied by b² gives a².<br>
  This means that ${n} divides a².<br>
  Using Theorem 1.2, if ${n} divides a², then ${n} must also divide a.<br>
  Therefore, we can write a = ${n}c, where c is an integer. <b>(Equation II)</b>
  `);

  add(`
  <span class="label">Step 7: Substituting the value of a</span><br>
  Now we substitute a = ${n}c from equation (II) into equation (I).<br>
  This gives ${n}b² = (${n}c)².<br>
  Simplifying, we get ${n}b² = ${n2}c².<br>
  Dividing both sides by ${n}, we get b² = ${n}c².
  `);

  add(`
  <span class="label">Step 8: Divisibility of b</span><br>
  From b² = ${n}c², we see that ${n} divides b².<br>
  Again using Theorem 1.2, this means that ${n} also divides b.
  `);

  add(`
  <span class="label">Step 9: Reaching the contradiction</span><br>
  We have shown that ${n} divides both a and b.<br>
  This means a and b have ${n} as a common factor.<br>
  But earlier we assumed that a and b are co-prime.<br>
  Co-prime numbers can have only 1 as a common factor.<br>
  This is a contradiction.
  `);

  add(`
  <span class="label">Conclusion</span><br>
  Our assumption that √${n} is rational is wrong.<br>
  Therefore, √${n} is an irrational number.<br>
  This completes the proof using the method of contradiction.<br><br>
  <b>Hence proved.</b>
